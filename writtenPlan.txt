Puzzle Game Bug Fixes - Assignment Solution

Problem Analysis:
In the current state of the puzzle game, there are a few bugs that need to be addressed:

1. Allowing multiple puzzle pieces in a single drop zone: The game currently allows users to drag and drop multiple puzzle pieces into a single drop zone. This behavior is incorrect and should be restricted to one puzzle piece per drop zone.

2. Puzzle pieces remaining in drop zones on reset or background change: When the puzzle is reset or a new background image is chosen, the puzzle pieces should be removed from the drop zones and placed back in the puzzle pieces section. This ensures that the game starts fresh and allows the user to drop the pieces onto the correct locations.

Solution:
To fix these bugs, we can implement the following solutions:

1. Restricting multiple pieces in a drop zone:
   - Modify the `handleDrop` function to check if the drop zone already contains a puzzle piece. If it does, prevent the new piece from being dropped.

2. Removing pieces from drop zones on reset or background change:
   - Create a new function called `resetPuzzle` that moves all the puzzle pieces back to the puzzle pieces section.
   - Add event listeners to the reset button and background image buttons to call the `resetPuzzle` function when clicked.

Implementation Steps:
Let's proceed with implementing the solutions step by step:

1. Open the JavaScript file that contains the puzzle game code.
2. Locate the `handleDrop` function and modify it as follows:
   - Add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the drop zone already contains a puzzle piece. If it does, return early from the function to prevent multiple pieces from being dropped.

3. Create a new function called `resetPuzzle`:
   - Inside the function, iterate over each drop zone and check if it contains a puzzle piece.
   - If a drop zone contains a piece, remove it from the drop zone and append it back to the puzzle pieces section.

4. Add event listeners to the reset button and background image buttons:
   - Attach a click event listener to the reset button and call the `resetPuzzle` function when clicked.
   - Attach a click event listener to each background image button and call the `resetPuzzle` function when clicked.

Testing the Solution:
To ensure that the bug fixes work as intended, follow these steps to test the puzzle game:

1. Attempt to drag and drop multiple puzzle pieces into a single drop zone and verify that only one piece is allowed per drop zone.
2. Click the reset button and confirm that all puzzle pieces are removed from the drop zones and placed back in the puzzle pieces section.
3. Choose a new background image and check that the puzzle pieces are reset and placed back in the puzzle pieces section.

If any issues or unexpected behavior is encountered during testing, review the code and error messages to identify the problem areas. Make necessary adjustments and modifications to fix any issues and ensure the game functions correctly.
